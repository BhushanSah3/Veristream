400]  Imagine, the year is 1905
[00:03
400 --> 00:07
800]  One day, the clock on the tower in Ben Switzerland is a little late
[00:07
800 --> 00:10
000]  Two minutes late to be more precise
[00:10
000 --> 00:14
800]  For that reason, a man who lives near the tower does not wake up at the same time
[00:14
800 --> 00:17
000]  that he usually wakes up to go to work
[00:17
000 --> 00:20
000]  Realising the mistake, he becomes a little nervous
[00:20
000 --> 00:24
200]  It takes him a little longer to get dressed, drink some coffee and leave the house
[00:24
200 --> 00:26
800]  He leaves five minutes later than usual
[00:26
800 --> 00:28
600]  He's about to cross the street
[00:28
600 --> 00:34
600]  Meanwhile, a banker gets into his new car without knowing that it has a problem with the brakes
[00:34
600 --> 00:38
600]  Our man crosses the street and doesn't see the car
[00:38
600 --> 00:40
600]  The man is run over and dies
[00:40
600 --> 00:45
600]  This man is no less than Albert Einstein
[00:45
600 --> 00:50
600]  That year Einstein should have published four works that would become the basis of modern physics
[00:50
600 --> 00:57
600]  Innovations like GPS, TV screens, the semiconductors that allowed us to create laptops
[00:57
600 --> 00:59
600]  never happen
[00:59
600 --> 01:05
600]  The computer, the laptop, the mobile you are watching this video on never come into existence
[01:05
600 --> 01:09
600]  And this video doesn't exist either
[01:09
600 --> 01:17
600]  This sequence of events is an example of what is known as the butterfly effect, a manifestation of chaos theory
[01:17
600 --> 01:23
600]  For many centuries, the world was explained through the laws of Isaac Newton in classical physics
[01:23
600 --> 01:30
600]  According to these laws, if the current state of an object is known, its future behavior can be predicted with relative ease
[01:30
600 --> 01:33
600]  Chaos theory questions this deterministic vision
[01:33
600 --> 01:37
600]  Not everything is predictable anymore
Not does it work like luck work
[01:37
600 --> 01:44
600]  Since the 1800s, mathematicians have raised the idea that not all phenomena could be predicted by Newtonian laws
[01:44
600 --> 01:50
600]  But a meteorologist named Edward Lawrence made chaos theory a visible phenomenon
[01:51
600 --> 01:58
600]  It all started in 1961 when he was working on a mathematical model to forecast the weather
[01:58
600 --> 02:05
600]  Lawrence entered data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind direction into his computer
[02:05
600 --> 02:09
600]  His computer would draw a graph, modeling what the weather would be like
[02:09
600 --> 02:12
600]  Not always accurate, but very close to reality
[02:12
600 --> 02:16
600]  One morning, Lawrence decided to verify some results
[02:16
600 --> 02:22
600]  He stopped the computer to save time, entered the numbers himself, and went to grab a coffee
[02:22
600 --> 02:26
600]  When he returned, the chart was incredibly different from the original
[02:26
600 --> 02:33
600]  At the beginning, it started out pretty similar, but in the middle, it presented a completely different trajectory
[02:33
600 --> 02:42
600]  Surprised, he checked the numbers
He found that the number he had entered was three tenths less than the number used by the computer
[02:42
600 --> 02:52
600]  That difference, which altered the trajectory so much, is equivalent to a particle of dust on the I-Fail Tower, or one less feather in the weight of a duck
[02:52
600 --> 03:04
600]  Lawrence deduced that this experiment was not a special case, that there were other systems in which tiny differences produced over time, monumental changes, making everything seem unpredictable
[03:04
600 --> 03:12
600]  That the flapping of a butterfly in Brazil, could, in theory, cause enough of a disturbance to spark a tornado in Texas
[03:12
600 --> 03:23
600]  Even though we have a good idea of how the universe works, there are no measurements that allow us to determine the exact position and speed of every atom in the universe
